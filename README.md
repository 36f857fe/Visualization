   We pick up some samples with large and small $\alpha$ achieved by APN on validation set of ImageNet-1K.From them we can observe that the samples containing simple objects and more redundant information have small $\alpha$, where MPN tends to representation decorrelation. On the contrary, the samples involving less redundant information (e.g., scene) have large $\alpha$, where MPN tends to information preservation. Such these phenomena show the consistency with our finding.
